# actions
- Create and manage Codex app workspace actions stored in `.codex/environments/environment.toml`.
- Add, inspect, update, or remove actions without touching unrelated environment config.

## How to use

2. Follow the environment action workflow for add, inspect, update, or remove operations.
3. You can run an action you made by clicking the action button at the top-right of the Codex app UI.

### Examples
- `$actions Make an action that rebuilds and relaunches the app.`
- `$actions remove the "Test" action.`
